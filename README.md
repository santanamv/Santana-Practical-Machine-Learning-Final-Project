# Santana-Practical-Machine-Learning-Final-Project
This repo contains my R markdown file, and HTML knitr document with my machine learning approach to predict the "classe" variable using the accelerometer data collected using devices like Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit. The data used in this exercise can be found at: http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. I have also included the two data files I downloaded and used as part of this exercise.
